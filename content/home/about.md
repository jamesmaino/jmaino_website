# Biography

I develop ecological tools to remotely sense and forecast insect populations (with a focus on plant pests). I am passionate about sustainable food systems and biodiversity preservation and believe enhanced sensing (data generation) and forecasting (data processing) of arthropod populations will improve their management.
