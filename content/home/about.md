# Biography

I research and develops tools that help us better manage some of our most notorious crop pests. I am passionate about food security, environmental sustainability, and biodiversity preservation. My current role at cesar as a Senior Research Scientist provides me a unique opportunity to apply my interests and expertise at the interface of these pressing issues.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking around Australiaâ€™s wide and diverse landscapes, while taking note of the smaller natural wonders that lurk underneath my feet.
