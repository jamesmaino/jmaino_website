# Biography

I develop tools to remotely sense and forecast insect population dynamics (with a focus on agricultural pests). I am passionate about sustainable food systems, and biodiversity preservation. I believe enhancing our ability to sense and forecast arthopod populations will help us to both manage pests and improve the situation for those species in decline. 

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking around Australiaâ€™s wide and diverse landscapes, while taking note of the smaller natural wonders that lurk underneath my feet.
