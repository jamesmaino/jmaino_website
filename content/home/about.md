# Biography

I develop ecological tools to forecast the dynamics of arthropod populations (with a focus on plant pests). I am passionate about the intersection of sustainable food systems and biodiversity. I believe enhanced sensing (data generation) and forecasting (data processing) of arthropod populations will improve their management.
