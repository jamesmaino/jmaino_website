  Description:
    Abstract:
      The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural
      Statistics Service (NASS) conducted an Agricultural Census in 2017.  The
      statistical census data are summarized at the county, state, and U.S. levels
      and are available in a digital format.  The Research and Development Division
      of NASS modified generalized county boundaries to show geographic areas for
      which the 2017 Agricultural Census statistics are reported at the county
      level.  These county-level boundary files were used in the production of
      the 2017 United States Census of Agriculture, Agricultural Census Web Maps.
      The boundary files can be employed in a desktop or online Geographic Information
      System (GIS) with the 2017 Agricultural Census statistical data by using the
      Agricultural Census county codes to associate the county-level spatial entities
      with the county-level statistical data.
    Purpose:
      The boundaries are intended for geographic display and analysis at the county-
      level.  The boundary data are designed for small scale thematic mapping
      applications at a scale of 1:20,000,000 or smaller (e.g., 1:50,000,000, etc.).
      The county-level boundaries are provided "as is".  The USDA/NASS does not
      warrant the results you may obtain using the Agricultural Census county-level
      boundary data.
    Supplemental_Information:
      These Agricultural Census county-level boundary files may be used with statistical
      data in the 2017 Census of Agriculture, Volume 1, Geographic Area Series, Parts
      1 - 50, and 2018 Census of Agriculture, Volume 1, Geographic Area Series, Part 52.

    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Unmodified entities have entity codes and names which conform to
      the American National Standards Institute's INCITS 31–2009[R2014],
      formerly Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 6-4, and 
      INCITS 38–2009[R2014], formerly Federal Information Processing Standard
      (FIPS) 5-2. Area values in square miles are derived from land polygon area
      values from the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER database.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: No topological checks were performed on the data.
  Completeness_Report:
    The generalized data do NOT include 1) boundaries for the Aleutian
    Islands in the Eastern Hemisphere, 2) boundaries for Hawaiian Islands
    west of -19942590.665742 m longitude (-160.555771 degrees), 3) very small
    polygons because of coordinate thinning, and 4) water polygons.  This data
    set provides the land area in square miles and in acres for each county
    equivalent (or agricultural census area in Alaska).  The land area values
    are based on the area of land polygons from the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER
    database. If a county is composed of several polygons, the area value
    assigned to each polygon is the land area value of the entire county (for the
    purpose of choropleth mapping).  Some of the county-level boundaries were
    modified to show geographic areas for which Agricultural Census statistics
    are reported.  County American National Standards Institute (ANSI) codes
    for the modified counties were replaced by Agricultural Census county codes.
    States with modifications to their county boundaries and county codes are -
    Alaska, Hawaii, Maryland, Missouri, Virginia (and the District of Columbia).
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The county-level boundary data are highly generalized and suitable
        for use in small scale (1:20,000,000) thematic mapping applications.
        No accuracy tests were performed.

        by multiplying the county land area in square miles by 640 (1 sq. mi. = 640 ac.).

        5 - Clip 2017 Agricultural Census county-level boundary file.
        Use 2012 1:20,000,000 US coastline boundary file to clip the 2017 1:20,000,000 scale 
        Agricultural Census county-level boundary file. Clipping the 2017 county-level boundary
        file by the 2012 coastline adds more detail (e.g., coastal inlets) to the 2017 county-
        level boundary file.
