Soil structure and health is critical to [water availability, nutrient cycling, and plant productivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD2DXBERTeg). By extension, soils will have strong associations with invertebrate community assemblage, diversity, and abundance and is thus a invertebrate science. 

Modern spatial datasets on soil are available to help us intergrate variation in soil characteristics in the prediction of invertebrate processes. In Austalia, one of the newer soil data sets is [Soil and Landscape grid of Australia](http://www.clw.csiro.au/aclep/soilandlandscapegrid/index.html). The data set is available as gridded rasters with a cell resolution of 3" (roughly 90m) and contains a range of variables including Bulk Density (Whole Earth), Organic Carbon, Clay, Silt, Sand, pH, and more. In addition, the data product includes information of landscape level variables such as Aspect, Relief 1000m Radius, Relief 300m Radius, Topographic Wetness Index, Topographic Position Index, and more. See the home page for more details.  


Here we see how the data set can be quickly accessed and visualised inside R through the `slga` package available on [github](https://obrl-soil.github.io/slga/). 

First we install the package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("obrl-soil/slga")
```

Then load the package.

```{r}
library(raster)
library(slga)
```

We can see what soil products are available.

```{r}
knitr::kable(slga::slga_product_info[,1:4])
```
#
```{r}
knitr::kable(slga::slga_attribute_info[,1:4])
```

Now let's get some data on my favourite place in Victoria - Gariwerd (Grampians National Park). Define the bounding box of the area of interest `aoi` using longitudes and latitudes in the form `c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`. Using the national dataset product `NAT` we get the estimated value `VAL` of the percentage of sand `SND` at a depth of 0-5 cm `depth = 1`.

```{r}
aoi <- c(142.138939, -37.645513, 142.694520, -36.843094)
sand_percent <- get_soils_data(product = 'NAT', attribute = 'SND',
                        component = 'VAL', depth = 1,
                        aoi = aoi, write_out = FALSE)
```
We can also extract information for a single point of interest (`poi`). 

```{r}
poi <- c(142.798591, -37.214808)
organic_carbon_percent <- get_soils_point(product = 'NAT', attribute = 'SOC',
                        component = 'ALL', depth = 1,
                        poi = poi)
organic_carbon_percent
```

With one line of code we can see the data interactively usign the `mapview` package, but for more customisability I highly recommend `leaflet` for interactive maps (`mapview` is a wrapper for this) and `tmap` for static maps. Note that the number of pixels is slightly reduced during plotting with `mapview`.

```{r}
mapview::mapview(sand_percent)
```

Similarly, we can get some landscape level information, such as the Topographic Wetness Index, which estimates the relative wetness within moist catchments (but is more commonly used as a measure of position on the slope with larger values indicating a lower slope position).

```{r}
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
wetness = get_lscape_data(product = 'TWIND', aoi = aoi, write_out = FALSE)
pal=get_brewer_pal("Spectral", n = 9,plot = FALSE)
tm_shape(wetness) +
  tm_raster(style = 'cont', breaks=c(1,3,6,7,8,12,15), palette = pal) +
  tm_layout(outer.bg.color = '#313338')
```
